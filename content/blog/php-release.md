# Introducing LAMP-Stack support on Deploy Now! Our approach to deploy dynamic websites 

Almost exactly one year after our first release, after many small improvements and evaluating and implementing your feedback, the first major feature release for Deploy Now has gone live. In addition to the already supported generators for static sites, we now also support the most famous web stack, the LAMP stack, and thus now also dynamic sites and the PHP frameworks Laravel and Symfony.

# How does deploying PHP on Deploy Now feel like?

Our main goal was to make the deployment of dynamic pages as fast and enjoyable as static pages. The first step of what we call our wizard to help you deploy your site is to link your GitHub repository. Now we get a picture of your code and help you set up your build pipeline. New to PHP: Files need to be made persistent and you may want to run commands on your runtime, you can define these deployment settings in the wizard and change them in a file afterwards.

We also help you to create environment variables for your runtime, that can be secret or not, and template a config file. You can create a database and reference itâ€™s key value pairs in your config file and set up a send mail account if you like.
